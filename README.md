# tidy_powerline_installer

This is a super easy way to install Powerline fonts on MacOS, with all the fonts grouped in a folder called "Powerline".

I highly recommend that you DON'T run this command. Piping scirpts to any shell command is insane (I'm saying this as a Cyber Security Expert). The practice needs to end.

If you're so inclined:

```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mvknowles/tidy_powerline_installer/master/install.sh | zsh
```

Please look at the script before running it!

Works on M1 MacOS!
